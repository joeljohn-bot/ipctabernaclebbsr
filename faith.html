              <li><b>We believe </b>the Bible to be the only infallible, authoritative Word of God. It is the final authority and foundation for all our doctrines and practices.
             </li>
             <li><b>We believe</b> there is one God, eternally existent in three Persons - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe that all things were created by Him and for Him.</li>
             <li><b>We believe</b> in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His visible personal return in power and glory.</li>
             <li>
                 <b>We believe</b> that God created human beings, male and female, in His own image. He created them sinless, equal in value, dignity and worth.
             </li>
             <li>
                 <b>We beleive</b> that, as a result of the Fall, all people are sinners by nature and in need of a Savior, and that Jesus Christ is the one and only Savior of the world. We believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is essential. That salvation is by grace alone through faith in Him. We believe that all who call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.

We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling and power, the Christian is enabled to live an empowered life of fruitfulness according to God's calling.</li>
              <li><b>We believe </b> that all of the gifts of the Holy Spirit mentioned in Scripture are available and active in His church today.</li>
              <li><b>We believe</b> in the literal return of Jesus Christ to the earth for the consummation of God's redemptive plan..</li>
              <li><b>We believe</b> in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost, they that are saved unto the resurrection of life, and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.</li>
              <li><b>We believe</b> that Christ commanded the Church to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every person, making disciples and baptizing those who believe in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit and teaching them.
              </li>
              <li><b>We believe</b>there is one church, the body of Christ, consisting of men and women from every tribe, tongue, people and nation. We believe that each local congregation is an expression of that universal church. We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ. We also believe in the mutual accountability of believers..</li>
